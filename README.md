2. About Problem 
```java
/**
* ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Nth FibonacciNumber
* ðŸ‘‘ Description: Find the Nth Fibonacci Number.
* ðŸŽ“ Explanation(optional):Any fibonacci number is give by sum of last two fibonacci number
*    before the number.
*    Ex. 
*    F(N):  0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...
*    N   :  0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8....
*    f(n)= {
*               0 for  n==0
*               1 for n==1
*               f(n-1)+f(n-2) otherwise
*          }

3. Stobogrammatic Number
  --java
  /**
* ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Count frequency of Stobogrammatic Number in given range.
* ðŸ‘‘ Description: Find thefrequencies and print it.
* ðŸŽ“ Explanation(optional):Strobogrammatic Number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees.
*  In other words, Strobogrammatic Number appears the same right-side up and upside down.
*    Ex. 
*    6 after 180Â° rotation : (6 â†’ 9)
     9 after 180Â° rotation : (9 â†’ 6)
     therefore 69 ,00,88,11, such are the numbers.
*    init={{"0","0"},{"1","1"},{"8","8"},{"6","9"},{"9","6"}}
*    dfs(int i,int left,char [] no,long l0w,long high,int [] c){
   for(char[] in:init){             
   no[left]=in[0];
   no[i-1-left]=in[1];
   dfs(i,left+1,no,l,h,c);
